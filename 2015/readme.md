Notes:

* day7 is brute force.  It would be nice to have a proper parser or to
have a proper constraint propagation algorithm.

* day8: It would be nice to have a python auto-complete working in
Emacs.  Maybe I will work through online guides, such as
https://ddavis.io/posts/emacs-python-lsp/

* day9: This is the Travelling Salesman Problem.  Wikipedia says some people approach it using an algorithm named  Branch And Bound.

* day15: This is pretty messy, but for now I just want to get it done and move on.
